# UChicago Wordle Tournament

Welcome... We're testing stuff out right now so there isn't much to say.

To install the tournament lib with pip, see the lib release here: https://github.com/Algo-Group-UChicago/wordle-tournament-lib/releases/tag/beta-testers-feedback

Install that mf and try to work through tournament.ipynb in this repo. Thank you!
